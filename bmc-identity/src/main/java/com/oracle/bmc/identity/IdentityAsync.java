     *   * If the tag was a cost-tracking tag, it no longer counts against your 10 cost-tracking
     *   tags limit, whether you first disabled it or not.
     *   * If the tag was used with dynamic groups, none of the rules that contain the tag will
     *   be evaluated against the tag.
     * <p>
     * Once you start the delete operation, the state of the tag changes to DELETING and tag removal
     * from resources begins. This can take up to 48 hours depending on the number of resources that
     * were tagged as well as the regions in which those resources reside. When all tags have been
     * removed, the state changes to DELETED. You cannot restore a deleted tag. Once the deleted tag
     * changes its state to DELETED, you can use the same tag name again.
     * <p>
     * To delete a tag, you must first retire it. Use {@link #updateTag(UpdateTagRequest, Consumer, Consumer) updateTag}
     * to retire a tag.
