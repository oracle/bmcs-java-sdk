     * To get a list of Availability Domains, use the `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation
     * in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
     * <p>
     * All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle-assigned,
     * unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
     * When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can
     * also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation
     * on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
     * <p>
     * When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual
     * network interface card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC
     * has a private IP address from the subnet's CIDR. You can either assign a
     * private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one.
     * You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the
     * addresses, use the {@link #listVnicAttachments(ListVnicAttachmentsRequest, Consumer, Consumer) listVnicAttachments}
     * operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call
     * {@link #getVnic(GetVnicRequest, Consumer, Consumer) getVnic} with the VNIC ID.
     * <p>
     * You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see
     * [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm).
