     * <p>
     * For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want
     * the load balancer to reside. Notice that the load balancer doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN
     * or backend set. If you're not sure which compartment to use, put the load balancer in the same compartment as the VCN.
     * For information about access control and compartments, see
     * [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
     * <p>
     * You must specify a display name for the load balancer. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
     * <p>
     * For information about Availability Domains, see
     * [Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm).
     * To get a list of Availability Domains, use the `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation
     * in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
     * <p>
     * All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including load balancers, get an Oracle-assigned,
     * unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID
     * in the response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type,
     * or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see
     * [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
     * <p>
     * After you send your request, the new object's state will temporarily be PROVISIONING. Before using the
     * object, first make sure its state has changed to RUNNING.
     * <p>
     * When you create a load balancer, the system assigns an IP address.
