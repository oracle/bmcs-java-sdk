 * Note: Objects should always be created or deserialized using the {@link Builder}. This model distinguishes fields
 * that are {@code null} because they are unset from fields that are explicitly set to {@code null}. This is done in
 * the setter methods of the {@link Builder}, which maintain a set of all explicitly set fields called
 * {@link #__explicitlySet__}. The {@link #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)} methods are implemented to take
 * {@link #__explicitlySet__} into account. The constructor, on the other hand, does not set {@link #__explicitlySet__}
 * (since the constructor cannot distinguish explicit {@code null} from unset {@code null}).
